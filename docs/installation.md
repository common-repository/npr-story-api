# Installation 

1. Download the plugin files from this repository
2. Unzip and upload the unzipped plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress install OR go to **Plugins > Add New** from the WordPress dashboard and upload the plugin zip file
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress
4. Use the **Settings > NPR Story API** screen to configure the plugin. Begin by entering your API Key, then add your Push URL and Org ID.

If you don't have an API Key or Org ID you can request them by [registering for an NPR account](https://secure.npr.org/oauth2/login).

The Push URL for the NPR Production API is `https://api.npr.org`.

The Push URL for testing purposes is `https://api-s1.npr.org`.

The Pull URL for production should be fine for testing as well: `https://api.npr.org`
